# AlmaBetter-Capstone-Project-1-EDA-Hotel-Booking-Analysis

Have you wondered about the best time of year to book a hotel room? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? Is there a way to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?
Those questions can be explored with the help of this hotel booking dataset.

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as time of booking, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern or affect the bookings.
